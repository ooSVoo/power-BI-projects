## Problem Statement

The e-commerce business for the financial year 2018-19 has experienced varying levels of success across different product categories, cities, and states. While the company has achieved a total sales volume of 5615 units and generated 1500 orders, the overall sales revenue of 432K has fallen short of the 500K target, indicating a gap in the company's ability to meet its sales goals.

Key challenges identified include:

#### 1. Geographical Sales Disparities:

Sales performance is highly concentrated in certain cities and states, with Indore, Mumbai, and Madhya Pradesh being the top contributors. This raises concerns about market penetration and brand presence in underperforming regions.

#### 2. Category Performance Variability:

There is significant variability in sales and profitability across different product categories. While Electronics leads in both sales and profit, other categories like Furniture and sub-categories with lower profit margins require strategic attention to improve their performance.

#### 3. Customer Base and Engagement:

The customer base, totaling 333 unique customers, needs to be evaluated to understand customer retention and acquisition challenges. The relatively small customer base may indicate potential issues with customer engagement or market reach.

#### 4. Profitability Concerns:

Despite achieving a 24K profit, the distribution of profit across sub-categories shows that some products are underperforming. This necessitates a closer look at the product mix, pricing strategies, and cost management to enhance overall profitability.
The company needs to address these challenges to optimize its sales strategies, improve market penetration, and align its product offerings with customer demand to meet and exceed its sales targets in the coming financial year.
